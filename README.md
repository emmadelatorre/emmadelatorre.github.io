## Question (3) from web exercise 1 assignment: 

Introduce ONE selected “data set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its URL and describe its potential applications and values.

Answer: [Link to Data](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset) When looking through the [awesome-datascience] data set list, I’ve actually used a lot of these websites and databases before, so it was very interesting to have some more to use in the future. The one I decided to look at that was very different from other data sets that I’ve looked at before is the “5000 Images of Clothing” one. I’ve worked a lot with both qualitative and quantitative data, but having a data set of solely images was very interesting and informative, as I know that images on their own can hold a lot of data within themselves. The file of the images was still a .csv file type, and some of the uses described for this data set to be used for are as follows: creating a tutorial or course, writing a book, Kaggle competitions, or training an internal model at a company. I thought it was interesting because again, I personally haven’t worked with much image data myself.


## Question (4) from web exercise 1 assignment: 

Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.

Answer: [Link to Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) I chose this book called "R for Data Science" because as someone who uses R a lot now, and has used R a bit in the past for data analysis, I always love finding new resources to help me be more fluent and comfortable with R. It's by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, and it overall seems like a really helpful resource for both people that are new to R, and for people who are already comfortable with R, but want to learn more.
